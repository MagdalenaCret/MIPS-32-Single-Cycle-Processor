# 🚀 MIPS Single Cycle Processor Project

## 📝 Overview

This repository contains the VHDL implementation of a 32-bit MIPS single-cycle processor developed as a laboratory project for the Computer Architecture course at the Technical University of Cluj-Napoca. The processor is capable of executing a unique program that processes arrays based on specific conditions.

## ✨ Project Description

The main objective was to design and implement a MIPS processor that executes a custom program.

## 🛠️ Program Functionality

The processor executes a program that performs the following operations on an array:

- Replaces elements less than X with their integer division by 8
- Replaces elements between X and Y with their doubled value
- Replaces elements greater than Y with 1

The array is stored in memory starting at address A (A ≥ 4) and has N elements. Values A, N, X, and Y are read from memory addresses 0, 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

## 💻 Implementation Details

### 📋 Instruction Set

The processor implements 15 instructions, including custom instructions:

- **🧮 Standard R-type instructions**: ADD, SUB, SLL, SRL, AND, OR
- **⚙️ Custom R-type instructions**: XOR, SLT (Set on Less Than)
- **🔍 Standard I-type instructions**: LW, SW, BEQ, ADDI
- **🔧 Custom I-type instructions**: ANDI, BNE (Branch on Not Equal)
- **↪️ J-type instructions**: J (Jump)

### 🧩 Processor Components

The implementation includes the following units:

- **🔎 IFetch** - Instruction Fetch unit
- **🔍 ID** - Instruction Decode unit
- **🎮 UC** - Control Unit
- **⚙️ EX** - Execution Unit
- **💾 MEM** - Memory Unit
- **✍️ WB** - Write Back Unit

### 🚀 Pipeline Version

The repository also includes an updated pipeline version of the MIPS processor with:

- ↪️ Additional Branch_N signal for BNE instruction
- 🛡️ Handling of data and control hazards using NOPs
- 🔄 Updated control flow for pipeline stages
